This project is for my thesis. I'll be doing a sentiment analysis of Twitter users in response to consumer data protection regulations like the GDPR and CCPA.
This repository will be used as a store of info gathered from Twitter in order to perform a geographic exploration of general user sentiment.
This will be used to generate figures for use in my thesis, that will showcase broad trends over time.
Thanks for reading!
